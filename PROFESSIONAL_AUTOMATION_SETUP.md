# 🤖 Professional Blog Automation Setup Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This guide will help you set up a professional, fully automated blog publishing system that:
- ✅ Automatically publishes scheduled blog posts daily
- ✅ Auto-commits and pushes changes to GitHub
- ✅ Auto-deploys to Vercel
- ✅ Provides detailed logs and monitoring

## 📋 Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with admin access
- Vercel account with project deployed
- Node.js installed locally (for testing)

## 🔧 Step 1: GitHub Secrets Configuration

### Required GitHub Secrets
Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add these secrets:

```
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token_here
VERCEL_ORG_ID=your_vercel_org_id_here  
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your_vercel_project_id_here
```

### How to get these values:

#### 1. VERCEL_TOKEN
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Get your token
vercel tokens ls
```

#### 2. VERCEL_ORG_ID & VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
```bash
# In your project directory
vercel link

# Or check your vercel.json file
cat .vercel/project.json
```

## 🚀 Step 2: Enable GitHub Actions

### Option A: Via GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
4. The workflow will be automatically enabled

### Option B: Manual Enable
1. Go to Settings → Actions → General
2. Select "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
3. Save changes

## 📅 Step 3: Workflow Configuration

### Automatic Schedule
- **Daily at 9:00 AM UTC** (10:00 AM local time)
- **Manual trigger** available from GitHub Actions tab

### What the workflow does:
1. 🔍 Checks for scheduled posts
2. 📝 Publishes posts that are due
3. 💾 Commits changes with timestamp
4. 🚀 Pushes to GitHub
5. 🌐 Deploys to Vercel
6. 📊 Provides detailed summary

## 🧪 Step 4: Test the System

### Test Auto-Publishing Locally
```bash
# Run the auto-publish script
npm run auto-publish

# Check what posts would be published
./publish-scheduled-posts.sh
```

### Test GitHub Actions Manually
1. Go to GitHub → Actions
2. Click on "🤖 Auto Publish Blog Posts & Deploy"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select "Run workflow" button

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

### View Workflow Runs
- GitHub → Actions → "🤖 Auto Publish Blog Posts & Deploy"
- Click on any run to see detailed logs
- Green ✅ = Success, Red ❌ = Failed

### Check Published Posts
- Visit your website after successful runs
- Check commit history for auto-published posts
- Monitor Vercel deployments

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Workflow not running"
- Check GitHub Actions is enabled
- Verify secrets are correctly set
- Check repository permissions

#### 2. "Vercel deployment failed"
- Verify VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
- Check Vercel project settings
- Ensure project is linked correctly

#### 3. "No posts published"
- Check publish dates in frontmatter
- Verify `status: "draft"` is set
- Check date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check scheduled posts
npm run auto-publish

# Test Vercel connection
vercel whoami

# Check GitHub Actions locally
act -l
```

## 📈 Advanced Features

### Manual Publishing
```bash
# Force publish all due posts
./publish-scheduled-posts.sh

# Publish specific post
npm run auto-publish
```

  - cron: '0 18 * * *' # 6 PM UTC daily (for multiple runs)
```
