## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I clean my email list?

Regular list cleaning is essential for optimal performance. Clean your list monthly for active campaigns, quarterly for comprehensive maintenance, and immediately when you notice deliverability issues or high bounce rates.

### What's the difference between hard and soft bounces?

Hard bounces are permanent delivery failures (invalid email addresses) and should be removed immediately. Soft bounces are temporary issues (full inbox, server down) and can be retried, but should be removed if they persist.

### How do I know if my email list needs cleaning?

Signs that your list needs cleaning include high bounce rates (over 5%), low engagement rates, deliverability issues, spam complaints, or if you haven't cleaned your list in over 3 months.

### Can I use email validation services for real-time validation?

Yes, many email validation services offer real-time APIs that can validate email addresses as they're collected, preventing invalid emails from entering your list in the first place.

### How does list hygiene affect email deliverability?

Clean lists with high engagement rates and low bounce rates significantly improve deliverability. ISPs use these metrics to determine sender reputation, which directly impacts inbox placement rates.
